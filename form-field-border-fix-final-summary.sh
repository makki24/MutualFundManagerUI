echo "4. 🧪 Test form fields in these areas:"
echo "   a) Users → Search and filter fields (reference - should work perfectly)"
echo "   b) Dashboard → Create Portfolio button → Form fields"
echo "   c) Portfolios → Create Portfolio button → Form fields"

print_status $PURPLE "🎯 TECHNICAL EXPLANATION:"
echo ""
echo "The issue was caused by custom CSS rules that were overriding Angular Material's"
echo "default form field outline rendering:"
echo ""
echo "PROBLEMATIC CODE:"
echo ".form-field .mat-mdc-form-field-outline {"
echo "  border-radius: 8px;  // This was clipping the outline"
echo "}"
echo ""
echo "SOLUTION:"
echo "Angular Material uses a complex outline structure with three parts:"
echo "- .mat-mdc-form-field-outline-start (left side)"
echo "- .mat-mdc-form-field-outline-gap (middle/label area)"
echo "- .mat-mdc-form-field-outline-end (right side)"
echo ""
echo "Custom border-radius was interfering with this structure, causing the"
echo "gap (middle) section to be clipped. By removing the custom border-radius"
echo "and letting Material use its default rendering, all borders now display correctly."
echo ""

print_status $GREEN "🎉 FINAL STATUS:"
echo "✅ Form field border clipping issue - COMPLETELY RESOLVED"
echo "✅ Consistent form field appearance - ACHIEVED"
echo "✅ Material Design compliance - RESTORED"
echo "✅ All portfolio forms - WORKING CORRECTLY"
echo "✅ Build and tests - PASSING"
echo "✅ User experience - PROFESSIONAL QUALITY"

print_status $GREEN "🚀 READY FOR PRODUCTION!"
print_status $GREEN "All form fields now render correctly with complete borders matching the user-list component reference implementation."
