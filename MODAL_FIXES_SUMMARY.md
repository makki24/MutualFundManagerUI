# Modal Fixes Summary - Mutual Fund Manager UI

## Overview
This document summarizes the fixes applied to resolve modal dimming and overlap issues in the Create Portfolio dialogs.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Modal Dimming Issue ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: All modals were appearing dimmed and input fields were not clickable after z-index changes.

**Root Cause**: 
- Z-index values were set too high (10000+) causing conflicts
- Backdrop z-index was lower than dialog content, creating layering issues
- Form elements didn't have proper z-index positioning

**Solution Applied**:
- Reduced z-index values to 1000+ range for better compatibility
- Fixed backdrop/dialog layering with proper stacking order
- Added specific z-index rules for form elements within dialogs
- Ensured pointer events work correctly for dialog interactions

### 2. NAV Field Overlap Issue ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: Initial NAV value field was overlapping with the info message "Portfolio will start with $0 cash".

**Root Cause**: 
- Form layout using flex-row was causing horizontal overlap
- Insufficient spacing between form elements
- Info note positioning was not properly separated from form fields

**Solution Applied**:
- Changed form layout from horizontal to vertical stacking
- Added proper margins and padding for form elements
- Implemented specific spacing rules for info notes
- Added container overflow handling

### 3. Dialog Configuration Issues ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: Dialogs were configured with `disableClose: true` which could contribute to interaction issues.

**Root Cause**: 
- Restrictive dialog configuration
- Missing proper backdrop and focus management
- Inadequate dialog sizing for different screen sizes

**Solution Applied**:
- Changed `disableClose` from `true` to `false`
- Added proper backdrop configuration
- Improved dialog sizing with responsive dimensions
- Added focus management and restoration
